# How to run the application

To launch the application, it is first necessary to generate the application image and then to generate the container
containing the application and the database by following the steps below.

- Under `View > Tools Window > Gradle` tab you can generate the application image by double-clicking on
  the `bootBuildImage` option
- After generating the image, the container must be generated by running the `compose.yaml` file, but first check that
  the name of the generated image is the same as the one in the `compose.yaml` file
- Once the container has been generated via `Docker Desktop`, you can run the container and use the app as if you had
  run it in the IDE

If you do not want to use the dockerized application, you can delete the `app section` from the `compose.yaml` file and
run the application through the IDE.
